# Routing Evaluation

This optional host-level evaluation compares the pinned upstream Superpowers
v6.2.0 skillset with Superpowers Lite. The execution protocol below uses Pi as a
fixed evaluation runner for reproducibility; Pi is not a runtime dependency or a
compatibility layer supplied by the package.

## Protocol

Run every fixture in `routing-cases.json` in a fresh context twice: first against
upstream v6.2.0, then against Lite. Use the same model, model version, sampling
settings, user prompt, and evaluator instructions for both targets. Do not reuse
conversation state between cases or targets.

Each report contains exactly one record for every `(caseId, target)` pair. The
only target values are `upstream` and `lite`:

```json
{
  "caseId": "authentication",
  "target": "lite",
  "expectedRoute": "Full",
  "observedRoute": "Full",
  "skillCalls": ["using-superpowers", "brainstorming"],
  "artifacts": ["spec", "plan"],
  "subagentCalls": 0,
  "reviewCalls": 1,
  "escalatedToFull": false,
  "pass": true
}
```

`upstream` records preserve what the baseline actually did. Their `pass` value
may be false when baseline behavior differs from the Lite contract. `lite`
records must pass the route contract. Do not fabricate model observations: if a
fresh run cannot be completed, leave the pair absent and let the validator fail.
Do not store prompts containing secrets, model credentials, or private source.

## Required Checks

The validator enforces pair cardinality, route names, safety-critical Full
routing, Micro artifact restrictions, Standard subagent restrictions, required
review evidence, and risk-discovered escalation. Run it from the package root:

```bash
node scripts/validate-eval-report.mjs evals/results/2026-07-12-initial.json
```

Generated JSON reports are ignored. Commit only this protocol, fixtures, the
validator, tests, and `evals/results/.gitkeep`.

# Fail-First Execution Evaluation

`execution-cases.json` evaluates the Full execution workflow at eight skill
profiles. Epoch 3 is the only admissible evaluation epoch. Epochs 1 and 2 and all
availability-smoke output are quarantined transport history and must not be read
into normalization or referenced by an accepted report.

Run every tuple in a fresh Pi process with this exact ordered isolation argument
list and fixed model identity:

```text
pi --no-extensions --no-skills --no-tools --no-context-files --no-session --mode json \
  --provider Mapleluv --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --thinking high \
  --system-prompt "$SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE" -p "$FIXTURE_PROMPT"
```

Evaluation concurrency is globally 1 across baseline, candidate, and integrated
runs. Each tuple has a 600000 ms silence-liveness threshold. A transport or
process failure may be retried sequentially at most three times, but the fixture,
evaluator prompt, generated system prompt, provider, model, thinking level, and
isolation flags must remain byte-for-byte identical. On Windows, terminate the
complete evaluator process tree before retry, evidence acceptance, or cleanup.
Preserve metadata for every attempt and record the accepted attempt number.

## Evidence Identity

A report is an object with `evidence`, `targetIdentities`, `evidenceIndex`, and
`results`. The report evidence fixes epoch `3`, provider `Mapleluv`, model
`claude-sonnet-4-6`, thinking `high`, the ordered isolation flags, the committed
fixture path/hash, the common evaluator-prompt path/hash, and
`sourceRepositoryPath`. That repository path must resolve to the current package
Git root; a report cannot substitute an unrelated repository.

Each `(target,profile)` has exactly one target identity containing the frozen
source base SHA/tree, wave-attempt ID, admitted patch SHA-256, candidate input
SHA/tree, and the same prompt/model/settings hashes. Baseline uses the SHA-256 of
an empty file as its patch identity and uses the Task 1 source commit/tree as both
its source base and candidate input identity. Candidate identities also supply a
patch path. The validator resolves both commits and trees through Git, loads the
source tree into a temporary index, applies the exact patch with
`git apply --cached`, and requires `git write-tree` to equal the claimed candidate
tree. This never mutates the package worktree.

Every `(caseId,target,repetition)` observation repeats the fixed evidence binding,
references the applicable target-profile identity IDs, and records:

- SHA-256 of the exact selected fixture prompt bytes;
- generated-system-prompt path and SHA-256;
- raw-response path and SHA-256;
- accepted attempt number from 1 through 3;
- shared observations and all fixture-declared `profileResults`.

`evidenceIndex.systemPrompts` and `evidenceIndex.rawResponses` contain exactly
one unique entry per selected observation; missing and orphan index entries fail.
The canonical evaluator instruction is committed at
`evals/execution-evaluator-prompt.md`. For each target, the validator reads that
blob, the fixture blob, and the fixed ordered eight-skill profile from the claimed
candidate Git tree, reconstructs the exact generated system prompt, and requires
byte equality with every indexed prompt. A report may keep exact blob copies in
its ignored evidence root so checkout EOL conversion cannot alter evidence; those
paths are locators, while the claimed Git tree is authoritative. The validator
also requires the parsed fixture document to match that tree-bound fixture copy.
A self-consistent caller hash is not provenance. The final settled lifecycle
must contain exactly one user `message_end`, whose text is byte-for-byte the
selected committed fixture prompt.

The validator reads every supplied fixture, evaluator, system-prompt, patch, and
raw-response path and recomputes its SHA-256. Missing or mixed epochs, targets,
bases, patches, prompts, settings, raw hashes, attempts, or identity fields fail
validation.

Raw Pi output is JSONL, not one JSON value. The shared parser reads every nonblank
line as a JSON object and validates every agent lifecycle as a balanced state
machine. Each non-final lifecycle is exactly one `agent_start` plus one
`agent_end` with `willRetry: true`; the final lifecycle ends with exactly one
`agent_end` with `willRetry: false`, immediately followed by the sole final
`agent_settled`. Duplicate, nested, or unpaired starts/ends fail. The terminal
`message_end` in the final lifecycle must be an assistant message with
`stopReason: "stop"`, no error or tool content, and nonempty concatenated text
blocks. Earlier retry lifecycles never satisfy a failed final lifecycle.
Collectors must import the same parser used by the report validator.

Profile observations use one authoritative, strictly ordered, uniquely identified
`events` array. Legacy `finalization`, `fullSuiteCallsBeforeFinalization`,
`intermediateClaims`, `sharedContract`, `l3Events`, `materialCauseEvents`,
`completionClaimed`, `completionAfterL3EventId`, `finalApproval`, `liveEffects`,
and `finishingEvidenceReused` fields are forbidden. Supported events cover
contract review, claims, L0, fanout, L1/L2, patch apply, commit, patch reverse,
commit revert, tree restore, finalization start, L3, material cause, approval,
completion, live effect, post-effect smoke, and finishing. Recovery has no
parallel booleans or counters: post-apply L1 failure requires ordered
`apply < failed L1 < reverse current patch < revert prior wave commits < clean
original tree`; post-commit union-L2 failure requires ordered
`all wave commits < failed union L2 < revert all wave commits < clean original
tree` and forbids reverse-apply. Every L3 and finishing event carries
clean HEAD/tree, exact command-set hash, and non-secret environment-fingerprint
hash.

A graph wave has unique wave/task IDs and exactly this order per wave:
`passing L0 < exactly one fanout < exactly one passing L1 per task < passing
union L2`; a prior wave's L2 precedes the next wave's L0. A high-risk contract
review event must be stable, reviewed, and pinned before fanout. An intermediate
claim names its prior passing L2 event and uses only a scoped L1/L2 claim. A graphless serial
chain has unique tasks in declared order, no fanout, one passing L0/L1 pair per
task, then a passing integration-boundary L2. A `finalization-start` event names
that passing L2 and carries all-waves-integrated, no-implementation-tasks, and
no-blocking-findings preconditions. Material reruns name an unreused cause after
the immediate prior L3, include passing fix L2, and change the state fingerprint.
Live effects require `L3 < approval < effect < post-effect smoke < completion`.

Wave tasks use normalized `owns` and `mutableResources`. Ownership accepts exact
repository-relative paths or a terminal `/**` bounded subtree only; absolute
paths, parent traversal, and other glob syntax are invalid. Same-wave bounded
subtrees must not intersect after conservative case folding, so case-only path
differences cannot claim disjoint ownership on Windows, and exact mutable-resource identities such as
ports, databases, caches, services, or temp roots must be unique across tasks.
Use an explicit empty list when a task owns none.

Normalize only behavior present in the raw response. Preserve generated prompts
and raw Pi JSON separately under the ignored controller evidence root. Never
manufacture an absent observation.

## Baseline RED Amendment

The 2026-07-20 Total Re-review correction makes RED sufficiency explicit. Run
and manually inspect every mapped case/profile cell, but require at least one
genuine RED across the mapped cases for each changed skill profile, not a
fabricated failure in every cell. Mapped cells where upstream is already green
are regression controls and Lite must keep them green. A profile with no RED
blocks or remaps that skill change. Missing or falsely normalized observations
still fail the gate.

## Recovery Branch Coverage Amendment

The final Total Review adds `failed-union-l2` as an eleventh fixture so the
post-commit recovery branch has independent fresh-context evidence rather than
sharing the post-apply fixture. This review-driven amendment supersedes every
earlier fixed ten-fixture/100-record cardinality statement; all provenance,
manual-inspection, and baseline-RED requirements remain unchanged.

## Cardinality and Modes

Run eleven fixtures, two targets, and repetitions 1 through 5 for a complete
110-record report. A complete baseline has exactly 55 records. Baseline profile
results may and usually should fail Lite assertions under the amendment above.
Every requested Lite profile result must pass its fixture assertion conjunction.

The validator accepts exactly three selection modes:

```bash
# Complete 110-record baseline + Lite report
node scripts/validate-execution-eval-report.mjs .superpowers/evals/epoch-3/final/report.json

# Complete 55-record baseline
node scripts/validate-execution-eval-report.mjs \
  .superpowers/evals/epoch-3/task-1-baseline/report.json --target baseline

# One target, one profile, and one or more cases (five records per case)
node scripts/validate-execution-eval-report.mjs "$REPORT_FILE" --target lite \
  --profile executing-plans --case successful-intermediate-wave --case finalization
```

Target-only Lite, case-without-profile, profile-without-case, multiple targets in
a narrow selection, or multiple profiles in a narrow selection are invalid.
Manually inspect every accepted raw response after collection. Validator success
does not replace checking that normalized observations reflect the actual answer.
